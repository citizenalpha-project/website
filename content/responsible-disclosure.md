At citizen alpha, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no
matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be
vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about
it, so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to
ask you to help us better protect our clients and our systems. This is also
called a „Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy“.

**Please do the following:**

- E-mail your findings to [hallo@citizenalpha.de](mailto:hallo@citizenalpha.de);
  if possible, encrypt your findings using our GPG key below to prevent this
  critical information from falling into the wrong hands.
- Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for
  example, by downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the
  vulnerability or deleting or modifying other people’s data.
- Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved.
- Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed
  denial of service, spam or applications from third parties.
- Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able
  to resolve it as quickly as possible.
- Usually, the IP address or the URL of the affected system and a description of
  the vulnerability will be sufficient, but complex vulnerabilities may require
  further explanation.

**Our responsibility:**

- We will respond to your valid report within a few days with our evaluation of
  the report. If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any
  legal action against you regarding the report.
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality and not pass on your
  personal details to third parties without your permission.
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem.
- We strive to resolve all problems as quickly as possible, and we would like to
  play an active role in the ultimate publication of the problem after it is
  resolved.
- On publication of this issue, with your permission, we will give credit to you
  as the discoverer of the problem.
